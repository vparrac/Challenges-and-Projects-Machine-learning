# Challenges of machine learning
This repository contain all the activities of the course IELE4014 Spring 2020 in Los Andes university. This course have two types of activities

## Challenge
A challenge is a small activity that try to test the theoretical knowledge in a application exercise. The topices of the challenges are following
1. Logistic regression with _sklearn_
2. Implementation of stochastic gradient descent and logistic regression
3. Linear regression with _sklearn_
4. Implementation stochastic gradient descent and linear regression
5. Neuronal netwotks with _keras_
6. Implementation of backpropation
7. Implementation of SVM with _keras_

## Project
The course had a total of three projects:
1. Convolutional neuroal networks in a classification problem.
